  By default, it assumes that the image corners are aligned.  Therefore,
  it adds .5 (since (0,0) is assumed to be the center of the upper-left grid
  cell), multiplies by the size ratio, and then subtracts .5.

  Args:
    coords: The coordinates to be converted.  It is of shape [..., 2] if
      coordinate_format is 'xy' or [..., 3] if coordinate_format is 'tyx'.
    input_grid_size: The size of the image/grid that the coordinates currently
      are with respect to.  This is a 2-tuple of the format [width, height]
      if coordinate_format is 'xy' or a 3-tuple of the format
      [num_frames, height, width] if coordinate_format is 'tyx'.
    output_grid_size: The size of the target image/grid that you want the
      coordinates to be with respect to.  This is a 2-tuple of the format
      [width, height] if coordinate_format is 'xy' or a 3-tuple of the format
      [num_frames, height, width] if coordinate_format is 'tyx'.
    coordinate_format: Which format the coordinates are in.  This can be one
      of 'xy' (the default) or 'tyx', which are the only formats used in this
      project.

  Returns:
    The transformed coordinates, of the same shape as coordinates.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if coordinates don't match the given format.
